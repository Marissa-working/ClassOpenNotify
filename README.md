## Introduction
<h3>Tired about checking the course search and enroll again and again? Let's go with a simple web scraper!</h3>
<h4>Get an email notification when class is not longer closed (best for classes without waitlist)</h4>
ex: I am using for genetics 133 in this case. Enroll the course successfully when testing the code!

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="./images/notify.jpg" alt="Email Notification" style="width: 40%;">
  <img src="./images/enroll.jpg" alt="Course Info" style="width: 40%;">
</div>

<h4>Or you can check how many people have already been in waitlist</h4>
